PartyGamer is currently in development, so it may not work as expected at the moment. If you find any bugs, please report them to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gatelogic/PartyGamer/issues).

A donation system is being put in place for Premium, but if it is not in place when the commands are avaliable, they will be free to use until the system is put in place.
